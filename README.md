# Lost-Choices
Lost Choices is a simple choice-based adventure game built for the web. The idea is straightforward: every decision you make changes how the story unfolds. Some choices help you move forward, others lead to unexpected endings.

This project started as a way for me to practice JavaScript logic and quickly turned into a fun experiment with branching storylines and game flow.
